# C Exercises Pack (GitHub Education / Classroom)

This repo contains small, beginner-friendly C exercises you can assign in GitHub Classroom.
Each folder is one exercise with:
- `README.md` (student instructions)
- starter code (students edit this)
- `test.sh` (simple local test runner)

## Requirements
- `clang` (or `gcc`)
- (Optional) CS50 library if you want to use `get_int` / `get_string`

## How students work
1. Open the exercise folder
2. Read `README.md`
3. Edit the starter file(s)
4. Run `./test.sh`
5. Commit + push
